# triage-rule-miner — Reversibility & Operations

**Status:** v0.1, propose-only, **off by default.**

## What it is
A nightly, read-only analysis tool. It consumes a `behavior.ndjson` metadata
export (produced out-of-band by the existing `gws` CLI) and writes two files —
`proposals.json` and `proposals.md` — into a directory you choose with `--out`.
It proposes one-tap Gmail filter ideas. It never applies them.

## Reversibility

This tool is reversible by construction.

- **Off by default.** Nothing runs on import. There is no installed cron, daemon,
  launchd job, or scheduler entry shipped enabled. The nightly job is documented
  but disabled; you enable it explicitly if you want it.
- **No state outside its own output dir.** The only writes are
  `proposals.json` and `proposals.md` under the `--out` directory you pass.
  No DB, no cache, no cross-run learning store, no dotfiles, no temp state that
  survives a run (the `--selfcheck` probe uses an OS temp dir that is removed on
  exit). A test asserts the process writes nothing outside `--out`.
- **Never mutates Gmail/Calendar.** The package imports stdlib only and imports no
  networking or subprocess module — it physically cannot call the Gmail API, the
  `gws` CLI, or any filter-create endpoint. Tests assert both invariants via an
  AST walk. The output is a suggestion file; you apply filters by hand, or not.
- **Uninstall = delete files.** To roll back completely:
  1. Delete the proposal files: `rm -f <out>/proposals.json <out>/proposals.md`.
  2. Remove the tool: `rm -rf tools/triage_rule_miner/`.
  3. If you enabled the nightly job, remove that scheduler/cron entry.
  Nothing else was touched. There is no migration to undo and no remote change
  to revert, because the tool never made one.

## Health probe
`python -m tools.triage_rule_miner.miner --selfcheck` exits `0` on the bundled
known-good fixture and non-zero on corrupt input. The nightly cron (when enabled)
should gate on this exit code before trusting a run.

## Usage
```
python -m tools.triage_rule_miner.miner --in behavior.ndjson --out ./out
```

# cron-silent-audit — Reversibility & Operations

**Status:** v0.1, read-only auditor, **off by default.**

## What it is
A nightly, stdlib-only auditor that READS the fleet cron registry
(`$HERMES_HOME/cron/jobs.json`) and the referenced script bodies under
`cron/scripts/`, then prints every *enabled* job that can fail silently
(delivered `local`/nowhere AND with no detectable alert path). It classifies
each into a verdict (`SILENT_SCRIPT_MISSING`, `SILENT_NO_ALERT_SCRIPT`,
`SILENT_NO_ALERT_PROMPT`, `SILENT_EMPTY_BODY`). It NEVER edits the registry,
re-routes delivery, or injects `notify.py`. The fix per job is a human
follow-up (route to `#alerts`/`#logs`, or add a `notify.py` call).

## Reversibility

This tool is reversible by construction.

- **Off by default.** Nothing runs on import. No cron, daemon, launchd job, or
  scheduler entry is shipped enabled. The nightly job is documented but
  disabled; you enable it explicitly if you want it.
- **Read-only — touches no state.** It opens `jobs.json` and script files for
  reading only and prints to stdout/stderr. It writes NO files, no DB, no
  cache, no dotfiles, no temp state that survives a run (the `--selfcheck`
  probe uses an OS temp dir removed on exit). It imports no networking or
  subprocess module in its hot path; it cannot mutate the registry or call any
  remote endpoint.
- **Uninstall = delete files.** To roll back completely:
  1. Remove the tool: `rm -rf tools/cron_silent_audit/`.
  2. Remove its tests: `rm -f tests/test_cron_silent_audit.py`.
  3. If you enabled the nightly job, remove that scheduler/cron entry.
  Nothing else was touched. There is no migration to undo and no remote change
  to revert, because the tool never made one.

## Health & liveness probes (NOT the same thing)
- **`--selfcheck`** — offline logic probe. Builds its own in-memory fixture,
  runs the classifier, asserts the verdicts. Touches NO real source; runs in
  the network-isolated floor. Exit `0` iff the logic is internally correct.
  This is the DEPLOY health check. It says nothing about the real registry.
- **`--check-target`** — real-target liveness. Asserts the ACTUAL registry
  exists, is a dict with a `jobs` list, and is non-empty; loud non-zero exit
  otherwise. The nightly entry runs THIS first, so "read nothing" can never be
  a silent exit 0.

## Usage
```
python -m tools.cron_silent_audit.audit --check-target   # nightly gate
python -m tools.cron_silent_audit.audit                  # flagged candidates
python -m tools.cron_silent_audit.audit --all            # every enabled job
```
Defaults: `--registry` = `$HERMES_HOME/cron/jobs.json` (fallback
`~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`); `--scripts-dir` = sibling `scripts/`.

# reaction_state — Reversibility & Operations

**Status:** v0.1, PROTOTYPE of the durable-state core, **off by default.**

## What it is
A stdlib-only Python 3.11 tool that turns raw Discord reaction *transitions*
into durable triage state in **its own SQLite DB**. It applies each add/remove
event atomically and idempotently keyed on `(channel_id, message_id, emoji,
user_id)` — with no dependence on whether the message was ever cached — and runs
a one-time boot reconcile sweep against a **watermarked** authoritative snapshot
to recover transitions missed while offline. Its transport-of-record is a local
append-only journal `reactions.jsonl` (one JSON line per raw transition) that a
future, non-stdlib gateway adapter would write.

It does **not** open a Discord gateway connection. `discord.py` (which owns the
raw `on_raw_reaction_add/remove` events) is non-stdlib; the live websocket client
is out of scope and is the seam where a later phase attaches. This tool defines
and tests that seam — it never opens a socket.

## Reversibility

This tool is reversible and bounded by construction.

- **Off by default.** Nothing runs on import. No cron, daemon, launchd job, or
  scheduler entry is shipped enabled. The nightly job is documented but
  disabled; you enable it explicitly if you want it.
- **State it touches:** exactly one file — the SQLite DB you name with `--db`.
  No dotfiles, no global state, no network. The `--selfcheck` probe uses an
  in-memory `:memory:` DB and touches no disk at all. Reconcile is **add-only by
  default**: absence in a snapshot never deletes durable state, so a bad or
  stale snapshot cannot destroy triage actions. Remove-on-absence is honored
  only when BOTH the caller opts in AND the snapshot declares it enumerates the
  full present-set; the nightly entry never opts in.
- **Cannot mutate Discord or call out.** It imports stdlib only and imports no
  networking, subprocess, websocket, or `discord` module. Tests assert both via
  an AST walk. It can only read its journal and write its own DB.
- **Uninstall = delete files.** To roll back completely:
  1. Delete the durable-state DB: `rm -f <the --db path>`.
  2. Remove the tool: `rm -f tools/reaction_state.py`.
  3. Remove its tests: `rm -f tests/test_reaction_state.py`.
  4. If you enabled the nightly job, remove that scheduler/cron entry.
  Nothing else was touched. There is no migration to undo and no remote change
  to revert, because the tool never made one.

## Health & liveness probes (NOT the same thing)
- **`--selfcheck`** — offline deploy health probe. Builds its OWN in-memory
  fixture, exercises apply + reconcile, and asserts the durable invariants.
  Touches NO real journal; runs in the network-isolated floor. Exit `0` iff the
  core logic is internally correct. It says nothing about whether a real journal
  exists. A garbage/unknown flag exits non-zero (real argv dispatch).
- **`--check-target`** — real-journal liveness gate. Asserts the ACTUAL
  `reactions.jsonl` exists, is a regular file, is non-empty, AND parses into
  >=1 valid event; loud non-zero exit otherwise. The nightly entry runs THIS
  first, so "read nothing" can never be a silent exit 0.

## Usage
```
python -m tools.reaction_state --selfcheck                          # deploy probe
python -m tools.reaction_state --check-target --journal reactions.jsonl  # nightly gate
python -m tools.reaction_state --journal reactions.jsonl --db state.db    # replay
```

# restore-canary -- Reversibility & Operations

**Status:** RESPEC v4, off by default, read-mostly drill.

## What it is
A nightly restore-drill for an encrypted `restic` home-lab backup. It decrypts +
restores ONE known sentinel file from the latest matching snapshot, hashes it
against a recorded sha256, and emits a secret-free PASS/FAIL artifact -- proving
backups are *restorable*, not merely consistent. The committed module ships only
pure logic + restic/`op` command builders and parsers; the live `--run` path is
host-only. Tests and both health probes exercise the builders/parsers over
self-built fixtures and never touch the network.

## Reversibility

This tool is reversible by construction and **off by default.**

- **Off by default.** Nothing runs on import. No cron, launchd, daemon, or
  scheduler entry is shipped enabled. The nightly job and the off-host heartbeat
  monitor are documented but disabled; you enable them explicitly.
- **Restore is to a throwaway target.** The live `--run` restores the single
  canary file into a fresh temp `--target` dir, hashes it, then the operator
  discards that dir. It never restores over live data, never writes into the
  backup repo, and never runs restic forget/prune (no destructive restic verbs
  are built anywhere in this module).
- **No state outside its own artifact.** The only durable write is the PASS/FAIL
  artifact JSON at the path you choose. No DB, no cache, no cross-run store.
- **Secrets stay scoped (B-3).** OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN is delivered ONLY to
  the scoped `op` subprocess env -- never to restic's env, never to argv, never to
  the artifact, log, stdout/stderr, exception, or heartbeat. A scrub pass strips
  any known secret value before any string is emitted. Tests assert all of this.
- **Uninstall = delete files.** To roll back completely:
  1. Delete any artifact JSON you generated.
  2. `rm -rf tools/restore_canary/`.
  3. If you enabled the nightly cron or the off-host heartbeat monitor, remove
     those entries.
  Nothing else was touched; there is no migration to undo and no remote change to
  revert, because the tool never made one.

## Health & liveness probes (NOT the same thing)
- **`--selfcheck`** -- offline deploy health probe. Builds its OWN fixture
  (config + captured-shape snapshots --json + a real temp canary file), verifies
  B-1/B-1r/B-3/R-3/R-4 invariants, and exits 0 iff the core logic is internally
  correct. Touches NO real source; runs in the network-isolated floor. A
  garbage/unknown flag exits non-zero (real argv dispatch).
- **`--check-target` / `--check-vault`** -- real-source liveness gate. Asserts the
  ACTUAL config file exists, is a regular non-empty file, validates, the required
  secret env (OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN) is present, and the repo mount_type is
  durable (R-5). Loud non-zero otherwise. The nightly entry runs THIS first, so
  "read nothing" can never be a silent exit 0.
- **`--audit-artifact <f>`** -- on-host artifact-integrity check (B-2, demoted):
  flags a stale / FAIL / unparseable artifact WHILE the host is up. It explicitly
  does NOT cover host-down -- that is the off-host PUSH heartbeat's job.

## Usage

    python -m tools.restore_canary.canary --selfcheck                          # deploy probe
    python -m tools.restore_canary.canary --check-target --config canary.json  # nightly gate
    python -m tools.restore_canary.canary --audit-artifact last-run.json       # on-host integrity
